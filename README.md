In this project we propose to develop a model for identifying whether there is free space in theparking lot image, or whether the parking is full.
The model would learn the pattern of full andfree parking spaces in different conditions i.e.  amount of cars, lighting etc.
This data-set contains 2.57GBof cars parking spaces images divided to 1067 images that con-tains free and available car parking and  2195  that  contains  full  and  unavailable  parking lots.
A future work idea is to build an application that connects to a street camera and notifies thedriver if there is a parking space next to his house.
